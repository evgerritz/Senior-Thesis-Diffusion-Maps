            <b>Abstract:</b>
            Many humans have the remarkable ability to correctly guess the artist of a painting they have never seen before, so long as they have seen enough other paintings by that artist. This fact implies there may exist an invariant between multiple works by one author, which we will refer to as “style.” A few questions then naturally arise: 1. Can we teach a computer to learn such an invariant? 2. If so, by analyzing what the computer does, can we arrive at an understanding of how humans perform this task? 3. How can we be sure that the computer is truly learning the invariant and not memorizing image statistics?

            We looked at Chinese calligraphy as an example of a particularly challenging instance of this problem. We hypothesized that the output of an intermediate layer of a sufficiently advanced deep neural network can be used as a kernel to learn a manifold of calligraphic style. We trained two network architectures from scratch and used their activations as kernels for the embeddings. Assuming the manifold of style is nonlinear, we used the diffusion maps nonlinear dimensionality reduction algorithm to assess a given kernel’s ability to cluster images of characters never seen by the neural network. To assess the validity of our nonlinearity assumption, we compared the results of this nonlinear embedding to a linear embedding using Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Additionally, we performed a qualitative analysis of several embedding kernels to understand what features they were trying to detect. Ultimately, we created a kernel that produced compelling clusters of calligraphers on the learned manifold of calligraphic style.
